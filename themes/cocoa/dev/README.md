This directory contains files that are purely used in development.
For instance, the `less` directory contains Less CSS files that
that are compiled to CSS in the theme's `static/css` directory.

The theme will work even if this directory is removed.

### Getting started

```sh
# compile less files to css.
make css
```

You may need to do `npm install -g lessc` if you do not have the less compiler installed.

### Versions in use

```
* lessc 2.7.1 (Less Compiler) [JavaScript]
```
